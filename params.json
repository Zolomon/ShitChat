One server, and one client. They communicate via a text-based protocol over TCP. Each connection is handled separately on its own thread, and full duplex communication is enabled due to two extra threads created to handle input and output respectively for each connection.\r\n\r\n### Evaluation\r\n\r\nA list of potential features was created early on in the beginning of the project. Most of these features did not end up in the end product. Architecting the protocol was an interesting and fun task. The decision was made to use a text-based protocol over a binary protocol, or a third-party serialization library like Google's Protobufs.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
