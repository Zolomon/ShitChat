{"name":"ShitChat","tagline":"ShitChat: a multithreaded client-server based chat application. Literal translation of the swedish word \"skitsnack\".","body":"### Welcome to ShitChat.\r\n![ShitChat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zolomon/ShitChat/master/images/shitchat.png)\r\n\r\n**ShitChat** is a cross-platform multithreaded multiuser client-server chat using functional style programming while adhering to the reactive manifesto to the best of its capabilities. ****cough cough****\r\n\r\n**ShitChat** was written by: @HannaBjorgvins, @3amice, @RobinSeibold, @Zolomon.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n*  **Accounts:** create an account, login to an existing account!\r\n*  **Profiles:** create a unique profile and read the profiles of your friends!\r\n*  **Channels:** create a channel, join an existing one, send messages to a whole channel!\r\n*  **Buddies:** see a list of connected buddies!\r\n*  **Whisper:** send private messages to your special friends!\r\n*  **ShitChat:** just ordinary chat!\r\n\r\n#### How to install?\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
